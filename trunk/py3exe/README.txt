Start working on a rewrite of py2exe.

Codename (in the repo) is py3exe.  Not sure if this will also be the
official name.

Planned features:

Compatible with Python 2.7, and Python 3.x with the same codebase.
Should work with 32-bit and 64-bit builds.
MemoryLoadLibrary will no longer be used.
