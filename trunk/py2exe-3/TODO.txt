Bugs:

- debug the 'verbose' argument to py2exe.  It defaults to 1, using
  '-q' sets it to 0, '-v' doesn't change it, '-vv' sets it to 2.
  Strange.

- Is this true any longer ???:
  ctypes com servers (inproc) do not work with bundle_files 2 or 3
  when the same Python version is used in the client.  Did this work
  at all with py2exe 0.6?

- distutils catches errors different from DistutilsError (or so)

- distutils_buildexe needs to import DistutilsOptionError (or so)

- Does probably not work with extensions built against the limited API
  (python3.dll)???

- py2exe for Python2 used an 'uac_info' string (exec_level) or tuple
  (exec_level, ui_access) attribute on the Target to include or patch
  a default manifest.

- custom_boot_script ?

- typelib ?

Ideas:

- clean up console output when building.

- add some scripts to inspect executables, like:
-     dump_manifest.py
-     dump_versioninfo.py
- or even a general resource dumper?

TODO:

- services cmdline_style not yet implemented

Fixed bugs:

  rev 380: - ctypes DLL COM servers can now load dlls (like sqlite3.dll) correctly.
  rev 343: - DLL com servers are now implemented
  rev 336: - py2exe\dll.dll is not installed.
  rev 342: - when installed as egg, py2exe/boot_common.py is not a file and so not found.
  rev 342: - number of icons (or icon images) is limited for whatever reason.
  rev 342: - extensions are in the wrong directory when library is in a subdirectory
  rev 342: - (String) Versioninfo not build?  (Needs 'self.version = "6.5"' attribute in Target???)
              Must include this into setup_template.py!
  rev 342: - services not yet implemented
