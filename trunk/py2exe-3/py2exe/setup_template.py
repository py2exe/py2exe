# ``zipfile`` and ``bundle_files`` options explained:
# ===================================================
#
# zipfile is the Python runtime library for your exe/dll-files; it
# contains in a ziparchive the modules needed as compiled bytecode.
#
# If 'zipfile=None' is used, the runtime library is appended to the
# exe/dll-files (which will then grow quite large), otherwise the
# zipfile option should be set to a pathname relative to the exe/dll
# files, and a library-file shared by all executables will be created.
#
# The py2exe runtime *can* use extension module by directly importing
# the from a zip-archive - without the need to unpack them to the file
# system.  The bundle_files option specifies where the extension modules,
# the python dll itself, and other needed dlls are put.
#
# bundle_files == 3:
#     Extension modules, the Python dll and other needed dlls are
#     copied into the directory where the zipfile or the exe/dll files
#     are created, and loaded in the normal way.
#
# bundle_files == 2:
#     Extension modules are put into the library ziparchive and loaded
#     from it directly.
#     The Python dll and any other needed dlls are copied into the
#     directory where the zipfile or the exe/dll files are created,
#     and loaded in the normal way.
#
# bundle_files == 1:
#     Extension modules and the Python dll are put into the zipfile or
#     the exe/dll files, and everything is loaded without unpacking to
#     the file system.  This does not work for some dlls, so use with
#     caution.
#
# bundle_files == 0:
#     Extension modules, the Python dll, and other needed dlls are put
#     into the zipfile or the exe/dll files, and everything is loaded
#     without unpacking to the file system.  This does not work for
#     some dlls, so use with caution.
