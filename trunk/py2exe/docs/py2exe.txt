py2exe - convert python scripts into standalone windows programs
================================================================

Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 Thomas Heller, Mark Hammond.

Abstract
--------

**py2exe** is a Python distutils_ extension which converts python
scripts into executable windows programs, able to run without
requiring a python installation.

It has been used to create wxPython, Tkinter, Pmw, PyGTK, pygame,
win32com client and server modules and other standalone programs.

**py2exe** is distributed under an open-source license_.

News
----

Please don't mail me directly about py2exe, please use the `py2exe
mailing list`_, which is also available on gmane_, via http_ and nntp_.

**py2exe 0.5.4 released (2004/10/22)**
--------------------------------------

The new ``--xref`` or ``-x`` command line switch instructs py2exe to
create a python module cross reference and display it in the
webbrowser.  This allows to answer question why a certain module has
been included, or if you can exlude a certain module and it's
dependencies.  This has *not* been extensively tested, but it's a
start.  Also, the html page includes links which will even allow to
view the source code of a module in the browser, for easy inspection.

A sample cross reference can be found here, note that the links to
open the .py files will of course not work over the internet:

Mark Hammond fixed some thread state issues with dll com servers, and
added support for standalone ISAPI dlls.

py2exe now can handle modules with '.pyw' extension.

It is now allowed to specify 'zipfile=None' in the setup script, in
this case the zip archive containing the python modules will be
appended to the exe file.

The announcement_, and the ChangeLog_.

What's new in py2exe 0.5
------------------------

The documentation is still to be written, but there is quite some info
available in the included samples, and in the wiki_ pages.  Thanks to
everyone who contributed.

Python 2.3 is required, because the new zipimport feature is used.
The zipimport mechanism is able to handle the early imports of the
warnings and also the encodings module which is done by Python.

Creates a single directory, which must be deployed completely.

Can create any number of console and gui executables in this
directory, plus optionally windows service exes, plus optionally exe
and dll com servers.  The com servers can expose one or more com
object classes.

All pure Python files are contained in a single zip archive, which is
shared by all the executables.  The zip archive may also be used by
programs embedding Python.  Since extension modules cannot be imported
from zipfiles, simple pure Python loaders are included in the zipfile
which load the extensions from the file system (without requiring that
the directory is in sys.path).

It is now simple to build py2exe from the sources, provided you have
MSVC6 installed - there are no dependencies on win32all sources.

The created executables are standard PE executable files now, no
longer is something appended to the exe portion.

Using py2exe
------------

Assuming you have written a python script ``myscript.py`` which you
want to convert into an executable windows program, able to run on
systems without a python installation.  If you don't already have
written a *distutils* setup-script_, write one, and insert the
statement ``import py2exe`` before the call to the setup function::

  # setup.py
  from distutils.core import setup
  import py2exe
	
  setup(console=["myscript.py"])

Running ::

  python setup.py py2exe --help

will display all available command-line flags to the **py2exe**
command.

Now you can call the setup script like in this way::

  python setup.py py2exe

and a subdirectory ``dist`` will be created, containing the files
``myscript.exe``, ``python23.dll``, and ``library.zip``.  If your script
uses compiled C extension modules, they will be copied here as well,
also all dlls needed at runtime.

These files include everything that is needed for your program, and
you should distribute the whole directory contents.

The above setup script creates a console program, if you want a GUI
program without the console window, simply replace
``console=["myscript.py"]`` with ``windows=["myscript.py"]``.

**py2exe** can create more than one exe file in one run, this is
useful if you have a couple of related scripts.  Pass a list of all
scripts in the ``console`` and/or ``windows`` keyword argument.

Specifying additional files
---------------------------

Some applications need additional files at runtime, like configuration
files, fonts, or bitmaps.

**py2exe** can copy these files into subdirectories of ``dist`` if they
are specified in the setup script with the ``data_files``
option. ``data_files`` should contain a sequence of ``(target-dir,
files)`` tuples, where files is a sequence of files to be copied.

Here's an example::

    # setup.py
    from distutils.core import setup
    import glob
    import py2exe

    setup(console=["myscript.py"],
          data_files=[("bitmaps",
                       ["bm/large.gif", "bm/small.gif"]),
                      ("fonts",
                       glob.glob("fonts\\*.fnt"))],
    )


This would create a subdirectory ``dist\bitmaps``, containing the two
``.gif`` files, and a subdirectory ``dist\fonts``, containing all the
``.fnt`` files.

Windows NT services
-------------------

You can build Windows NT services by passing a ``service`` keyword
argument to the ``setup`` function, the value must be a list of Python
module names containing a service class (identified by the ``_svc_name_``
attribute)::

  # setup.py
  from distutils.core import setup
  import py2exe
	
  setup(service=["MyService"])

The built service executables are able to install and remove
themselves by calling them with certain command line flags, run the
exe with the ``-help`` argument to find out more.

COM servers
-----------

COM servers are built by passing a ``com_server`` keyword argument to
the setup function, again the value must be a list of Python module
names containing one or more COM server classes (identified by their
``_reg_progid_`` attribute)::

  # setup.py
  from distutils.core import setup
  import py2exe
	
  setup(com_server=["win32com.server.interp"])

By default both DLL and EXE servers are built, you should simply
delete those you don't need.

Advanced features
-----------------

Still to be written.
So far, you have to look into the supplied samples.

There is also a wiki_ now where you can look for information, or
publish your tips.

How does it work?
-----------------

**py2exe** uses python's ``modulefinder`` to examine your script and
find all python and extension modules needed to run it. Pure python
modules are compiled into ``.pyc`` or ``.pyo`` files in a temporary
directory. Compiled extension modules (``.pyd``) are also found and
parsed for binary dependencies.

A zip-compatible archive is built, containing all python files from
this directory.  Your main script is inserted as a resource into a
custom embedded python interpreter supplied with py2exe, and the
zip-archive is installed as the only item on ``sys.path``.

In simple cases, only ``pythonxx.dll`` is needed in addition to
``myscript.exe``. If, however, your script needs extension modules,
unfortunately those cannot be included or imported from the
zip-archive, so they are needed as separate files (and are copied into
the ``dist`` directory).

*Attention*: **py2exe** tries to track down all binary dependencies
for all pyd's and dll's copied to the dist directory recursively, and
copies all these dependend files into the dist directory. **py2exe**
has a builtin list of some system dlls which are not copied, but this
list can never be complete.

Installing py2exe
-----------------

Download and run the installer py2exe-0.5.4.win32-py2.3.exe_ (for
Python 2.3), or py2exe-0.5.4.win32-py2.4.exe_ (for Python 2.4,
currently in beta).

This installs **py2exe** together with some samples, the samples are in
the ``lib\site-packages\py2exe\samples`` subdirectory.

For **Windows 95/98/Me**, you need the *Microsoft Layer for Unicode on
Windows 95/98/ME Systems (MSLU)* dll from here_ (Internet Explorer is
required to download it: Scroll down to the Win95/98/Me section).

Download and run the self-extracting ``unicows.exe`` file, and copy
the unpacked ``unicows.dll`` file in the directory which contains your
``python.exe``.  Note that this is only needed on the machine where
you want to build executables with **py2exe**, it is not required on
the machine where you want to run the created programs.

If you use ``py2exe`` to build COM clients or servers, win32all build
163 (or later) is strongly recommened - it contains much better support
for frozen executables.
