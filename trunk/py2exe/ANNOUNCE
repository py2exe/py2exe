py2exe 0.6.1 released
=====================

py2exe is a Python distutils extension which converts python scripts
into executable windows programs, able to run without requiring a
python installation.  Console and Windows (GUI) applications, windows
NT services, exe and dll COM servers are supported.

Changes in this release:

    * py2exe can now bundle binary extensions and dlls into the
      library-archive or the executable itself.  This allows to
      finally build real single-file executables.

      The bundled dlls and pyds are loaded at runtime by some special
      code that emulates the Windows LoadLibrary function - they are
      never unpacked to the file system.
      
    * By default py2exe now includes the codecs module and the
      encodings package.
      
    * Several other fixes.
