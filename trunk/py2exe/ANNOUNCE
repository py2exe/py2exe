py2exe 0.6.8 released
=====================

py2exe is a Python distutils extension which converts Python scripts
into executable Windows programs, able to run without requiring a
Python installation. Console and Windows (GUI) applications, Windows
NT services, exe and dll COM servers are supported.

Changes in 0.6.8:

    * Support for relative imports.

    * Fix MemoryLoadLibrary to handle loading function addresses by ordinal
      numbers. Patch and test by Matthias Miller.

    * Using the options compressed=1, bundle_files=3, and zipfile=None at
      the same time now works; patch from Alexey Borzenkov.

    * Allow renaming of single-executable files; patch from Alexey
      Borzenkov.

    * Embedding icon resources into the image now works correctly even for
      ico files containing multiple images.

    * pyd files from different packages with the same filename no longer
      conflict. Patch from Grant Edwards.

    * There are new samples for the 'typelibs' support, including the new
      option of pre-generating a typelib and specifying the file as an
      input to py2exe.

    * The test suite is now included in the source distribution.


Changes in 0.6.6:

    * Better support for Python 2.5.

    * Experimental support for 64-bit builds of Python on win64.

    * Better ISAPI support.

    * New samples for ISAPI and COM servers.

    * Support for new "command-line styles" when building Windows services.

Changes in 0.6.5:

    * Fixed modulefinder / mf related bugs introduced in 0.6.4. This
      will be most evident when working with things like
      win32com.shell and xml.xpath.

    * Files no longer keep read-only attributes when they are copied
      as this was causing problems with the copying of some MS DLLs.

Changes in 0.6.4:

    * New skip-archive option which copies the Python bytecode files
      directly into the dist directory and subdirectories - no
      archive is used.

    * An experimental new custom-boot-script option which allows a
      boot script to be specified (e.g., --custom-boot-script=cbs.py)
      which can do things like installing a customized stdout
      blackhole. See py2exe's boot_common.py for examples of what can
      be done. The custom boot script is executed during startup of
      the executable immediately after boot_common.py is executed.

    * Thomas Heller's performance improvements for finding needed
      modules.

    * Mark Hammond's fix for thread-state errors when a py2exe
      created executable tries to use a py2exe created COM DLL.

Changes in 0.6.3:

    * First release assembled by py2exe's new maintainer, Jimmy
      Retzlaff. Code changes in this release are from Thomas Heller
      and Gordon Scott.

    * The dll-excludes option is now available on the command line.
      It was only possible to specify that in the options argument to
      the setup function before.

      The dll-excludes option can now be used to filter out dlls like
      msvcr71.dll or even w9xpopen.exe.

    * Fix from Gordon Scott: py2exe crashed copying extension modules
      in packages.

Changes in 0.6.2:

    * Several important bugfixes:

      - bundled extensions in packages did not work correctly, this
        made the wxPython single-file sample fail with newer wxPython
        versions.

      - occasionally dlls/pyds were loaded twice, with very strange
        effects.

      - the source distribution was not complete.

      - it is now possible to build a debug version of py2exe.

Changes in 0.6.1:

    * py2exe can now bundle binary extensions and dlls into the
      library-archive or the executable itself.  This allows to
      finally build real single-file executables.

      The bundled dlls and pyds are loaded at runtime by some special
      code that emulates the Windows LoadLibrary function - they are
      never unpacked to the file system.

      This part of the code is distributed under the MPL 1.1, so this
      license is now pulled in by py2exe.

    * By default py2exe now includes the codecs module and the
      encodings package.

    * Several other fixes.
