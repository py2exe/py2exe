py2exe 0.6.3 released
=====================

py2exe is a Python distutils extension which converts Python scripts
into executable Windows programs, able to run without requiring a
Python installation. Console and Windows (GUI) applications, Windows
NT services, exe and dll COM servers are supported.

Changes in 0.6.3:

    * First release assembled by py2exe's new maintainer, Jimmy
      Retzlaff. Code changes in this release are from Thomas Heller
      and Gordon Scott.

    * The dll-excludes option is now available on the command line.
      It was only possible to specify that in the options argument to
      the setup function before.

      The dll-excludes option can now be used to filter out dlls like
      msvcr71.dll or even w9xpopen.exe.

    * Fix from Gordon Scott: py2exe crashed copying extension modules
      in packages.

Changes in 0.6.2:

    * Several important bugfixes:

      - bundled extensions in packages did not work correctly, this
        made the wxPython single-file sample fail with newer wxPython
        versions.

      - occasionally dlls/pyds were loaded twice, with very strange
        effects.

      - the source distribution was not complete.

      - it is now possible to build a debug version of py2exe.

Changes in 0.6.1:

    * py2exe can now bundle binary extensions and dlls into the
      library-archive or the executable itself.  This allows to
      finally build real single-file executables.

      The bundled dlls and pyds are loaded at runtime by some special
      code that emulates the Windows LoadLibrary function - they are
      never unpacked to the file system.

      This part of the code is distributed under the MPL 1.1, so this
      license is now pulled in by py2exe.

    * By default py2exe now includes the codecs module and the
      encodings package.

    * Several other fixes.
