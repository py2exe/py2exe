**py2exe 0.5.3** released
===================================

py2exe is a Python distutils extension which converts python scripts
into executable windows programs, able to run without requiring a
python installation.  Console and Windows (GUI) applications, windows
NT services, exe and dll COM servers are supported.

This release fixes a few bugs in the 0.5.2 version:

    * The windows installer has been fixed to avoid problems when
      doing non-admin installs.  Thanks to Harald A. Massa for testing.

    * Applied a patch from Mark Hammond to correctly manage the thread
      state in dll COM servers.

    * Add a line feed to the script's code, to avoid problems
      byte-compiling it when it contains trailing white space.

    * Fix a problem with Python 2.4 when no extension modules are
      needed - py2exe didn't track down that python24.dll is needed.


py2exe 0.5.2 is a bugfix release.
    
    * Print a message explaining what's going on whan a service
      exe is started from the command line.

    * py2exe did build invalid version resources, they didn't show up
      correctly on Win98 at least.  Patch by Roger Upole.

    * Fix a buffer overflow in the C code.  Patch by Ralf Sieger, closes
      bug item #893310

    * py2exe now (again) has a builtin list of dlls which should never be
      distributed

    * Patch sys.winver in the distributed pythonXY.dll, so that there is
      no possibility of conflicts with existing distributions and the
      registry keys found there.  Patch by Mark Hammond.

    * Fix several problems when an exception in a 'windows' exe occurs.

    * Include a workaround for unbounded recursion in modulefinder when
      Jason Jorendorff's path module is installed
      See also http://python.org/sf/876278

    * Fix problems when package_dir is set in the setup script,
      see http://tinyurl.com/yuc5l

    * py2exe can now be built from the sources with mingw32

    * py2exe does now handle precompile .pyo and .pyc files (patch by
      Shane Holloway)

    * Fix a problem when the exe's directory contains single quotes

    * Register service dependencies when installing a service

    * Return an exit code of 255 from the exe when there's an uncatched
      exception running the main script.

    * Print a warning instead of failing to build with weird version numbers.
