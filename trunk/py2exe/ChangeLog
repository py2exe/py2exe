	* Fix the import from extensions in packages.  This made newer
	versions of wxPython (for example) fail.

2005-09-05  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe 0.6.1 released.

	* docs\py2exe.txt: Updated the html-pages.

2005-04-28  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe can now bundle binary extensions and dlls into the zip
	archive, and load them with a custom zipextimporter.  This uses
	code originally written by Joachim Bauch and enhanced by me, which
	simulates the LoadLibrary windows api call.  The exe stubs now use
	runtime dynamic loading of the Python dll.

	* py2exe does now by default include the codecs module and the
	complete encodings package.

	* py2exe\boot_service.py: Patch from Cory Dodt to allow building a
	service from a module inside a package.

	* py2exe\build_exe.py (py2exe.find_needed_modules): Another patch
	from Shane Holloway to handle packages with multiple entries in a
	package's __path__ list.

2004-12-30  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe\build_exe.py (py2exe.find_needed_modules.visit): Patch
	from Shane Holloway for better modulefinder's AddPackagePath
	interactions.

	* source\start.c: Patch from David Bolen, to make the unbuffered
	option work.

2004-10-22  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	*  py2exe can now create module crosss references in HTML format,
	and displays them in the default browser.

2004-09-22  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	*  py2exe\build_exe.py: Added the .pyw extension for Python modules.

2004-09-06 Mark Hammond <mhammond@skippinet.com.au>

	* Support for stand-alone ISAPI DLL.

2004-06-02  Mark Hammond <mhammond@skippinet.com.au>
2004-08-24  Mark Hammond <mhammond@skippinet.com.au>

	* Various 'thread-state' issues in COM DLL support.

2004-07-30  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe\build_exe.py: zipfile can now be specified as None, in
	this case the Python modules library archive is appended to the
	exe-files created.  Doesn't make too much sense in the normal case
	probably, but prepares the way to single file executables.

2004-07-29  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe\build_exe.py: When using static built
	templates, python.dll may not be needed anymore.

2004-07-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (Message): py2exe 0.5.3 released.

2004-07-13  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source\run_dll.c: From Mark Hammond: patch to correctly manage
	the thread state.

	* py2exe\build_exe.py (py2exe.build_executable): Add a line feed
	to the script's code, to avoid problems compiling it when it
	contains trailing white space.

	* py2exe\build_exe.py: Fix a problem with 2.4 when no extension
	modules are needed - py2exe didn't track that python24.dll is
	needed.  Add the '_emx_link' symbol to the ignored imports list.

2004-07-09  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	*  (Message): py2exe 0.5.2 released.

	* source\run_dll.c: I took out again Mark's threadstate patch, it
	breaks registering dll COM servers.

2004-07-08  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	*  (Message): py2exe 0.5.1 released.

2004-06-09  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source\start.c (run_script): Return an exit code of 255 when
	there's an uncatched exception in the main script.

2004-06-08  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe\boot_service.py: Register service dependencies when a
	service is started with the -install flag.

	* source\start.c (run_script): Triple-quote sys.path with double
	quotes to avoid problems if the directory contains single quotes
	(double quotes are impossible on Windows).

	* py2exe\build_exe.py: Support for precompiled .pyc and .pyo
	files, based on a patch from Shane Holloway.

2004-06-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source\run_dll.c: From Mark Hammond: patch to correctly manage
	the thread state.

2004-06-01  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* setup.py, source/icon.rc: Change so that py2exe can be built
	with mingw32.

2004-04-28  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe\build_exe.py: Run the 'build' command before actually
	building the exe, and insert the lib and plat_lib directories to
	sys.path.  After the exe is built, sys.path is restored.

2004-04-27  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe\build_exe.py: Fix ModuleFinders import_module() method,
	see http://python.org/sf/876278.  I assume the fix will it make
	into Python 2.4, but not earlier versions.

2004-04-26  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (Message): Add flush() methods to the Blackhole and Stderr
	objects for windows programs.


2004-04-18  Mark Hammond
	
	* (build_exe.py): Patch sys.winver in the distributed
	pythonxx.dll, so that there is no possibility of conflicts with
	existing distributions and the registry keys found there.  Of
	note, ActivePython/old win32all versions registered 'Modules', and
	these were used in preference to the one shipped with py2exe,
	generally causing problem.

2004-04-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (EXCLUDED_DLLS): Readded the builtin list of system dlls to
	exclude.

2004-03-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source\py2exe_util.c: The code was calling CreateFileW directly
	instead of the function in unicows.dll, this had the effect that
	the icons could not be changed on Win98.

2004-03-12  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe\resources\VersionInfo.py: Version resource built by
	py2exe was wrong: found by Roger Upole, reported on c.l.p

2004-03-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* py2exe\boot_service.py: Print a message when a service exe is
	started from the command line.

	* py2exe\build_exe.py: makepy code generation with bForDemand=True is buggy.
	Use bForDemand=False instead.
	

2004-02-17  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source\start.c (init_with_instance): Fixed a bufferoverflow when
	the exe is run in a directory with a long name, found by Ralf Sieger.
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=893310&group_id=15583&atid=115583

	* py2exe\boot_common.py: Fix two problems found by Mathew
	Thornley: Could not open the logfile because the 'sys' symbol was
	no longer defined. Wrong wording when the logfile could not be
	opened.
