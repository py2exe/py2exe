Current BUGS:

  Should make support.py more robust

Fixed BUGS:

  Scripts MUST end with a newline, otherwise they
  will raise a syntax error when executed with PyRun_SimpleString().

  If 'setup.py py2exe -g' is started, extensions are built
  in release mode, not in debug mode

Workaround:

  run 'setup.py build_ext -g py2exe -g'

Without an external zip-utility, a partial zip-file
is included into the exe-file.
